## Core Features:

- Micro-Interaction Animations: GSAP animations, Framer Motion, Anime.js, and Three.js animations are triggered on hover, touch, or scroll events.
- Cinematic Transitions: Smooth in-out animations and scroll-triggered effects on content cards, combined with custom cursors and kinetic effects.
- Signature Branding Integration: Ensure the '/Slash' branding is consistently displayed through logos, dividers, or motion signatures throughout the website.
- Fixed Footer Reveal: Footer remains fixed and is revealed by animating content cards upward as users scroll to the bottom.
- Mobile-First Responsiveness: Responsive design ensures card and bento box layouts adapt smoothly across all devices.
- Loading Animations: Generate creative loading screens for different image types using GSAP animations to entertain and inform the user while the application loads. Uses AI to select appropriate animations.
- Smooth Scrolling: Implement smooth, butter-like scrolling for enhanced user experience.
- Dynamic Island Navbar: Create a pill-shaped navbar similar to Apple's Dynamic Island with unique animations and transitions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Black (#000000) for a luxurious and bold feel.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) to maintain a contrasting, clean visual.
- Header font: 'Instrumental Serif' for headlines.
- Body font: 'Parkinsans' for normal text.
- Bento box layout for the hero section, using solid boxes and clear segmentation for content pages (card or grid-based).
- Utilize GSAP, Framer Motion, Anime.js, and Three.js for transitions and interactions to create a cinematic experience. Implement sequence reveals, parallax morphs, and 3D tilts.
- Use only solid colors, scaling, blurring, cutting, morphing, slicing, and motion effects; avoid opacity or transparency.
- Cards and content elements should animate by being 'pushed/pulled up', revealing the fixed position footer as the content scrolls to the bottom. A GSAP loading screen must be included before entering the main webpage.
- Dynamic Island-style navbar with smooth transitions and animations.
